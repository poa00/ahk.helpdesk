In order to use this program, you must have autohotkey on your computer. At the moment, no compiled version is available, since the libs folder does not integrate well into a compiled exe. 
There is a portable autohotkey file available here: https://autohotkey.com/download/ which does not require installation or admin rights. To use this version, right click on WorkHotkeys.ahk
and select open with... and then choose program. From there, click browse, and find autohotkey.exe. This will compile and run the script. The script will run in the background, listening for
any hotkeys. In order to have the script run at startup, make a shortcut to the script (right click, make shortcut), and then place it in the startup folder.
